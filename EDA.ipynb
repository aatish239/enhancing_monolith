The animation in My opinion was crisp, clean, and really clear. Not to mention beautiful! Most of the characters in this show are hilarious like the Looney Tunes characters that we all love. in My opinion these characters are the funnies and talented ever seen. In fact, The things that goes on in this series' cartoons are in My opinion nuts which that is what makes them hilarious! There are so many to like and laugh at and the silly things they do! If you like the original Looney Tunes then I strongly recommend that you watch this show!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    5\n",
       "The \"Hunting Trilogy\" of Rabbit Fire (1951), Rabbit Seasoning (1952), and Duck! Rabbit! Duck! (1953) should be considered the comedic high water mark of the Chuck Jones-Michael Maltese collaboration. While they are seldom mentioned in lists of the \"greatest\" or \"most important\" cartoons in the history of animation, they are certainly THE FUNNIEST cartoons I've ever seen. Michael Maltese never got the credit that directors like Jones, Freleng or Avery got, but it's his dialogue and situations that make Warner Bros. cartoons, and these three in particular, some of the FUNNIEST ever made.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          3\n",

Larry discovers the deceit just as a murder is committed and Pat is to stand trial for the crime.

She's smart, hard-working and they gradually fall in love, with many a quip, when a murdered woman pops up -- and it looks exactly like the picture of Miss Kelly that she posed for the magazine; her alibi is Mr. Terry, but he's been shipped out on a convoy to Russia and lost at sea.\\n\\nRichard Gaines is along as the health-nut publisher, and there are a lot of good gags for the first three-quarters of the picture, until the murder mystery takes over.

       "How many films from the 1940s start with the misunderstanding caused by a name that could belong to either a man or a woman? That's how Double Exposure begins. Magazine editor Larry Burke (Chester Morris) hires a photographer he's never met named \"Pat\" (Nancy Kelly). Of course \"Pat\" ends up being a woman, setting the stage for a few laughs and a predictable romance. Things get complicated, however, when: (a) Pat's old beau shows up, and (b) Pat is accused of murder.\\n\\nDouble Exposure isn't anything deep, but it is a decent little film that I found reasonably entertaining. For me, the comedy bits (especially those involving the health-nut magazine owner) far outweighed the mystery elements. The killer's real identity was way too easy to guess. The film is also helped along by some snappy direction and pacing. Director William Berke really keeps things moving. The film's highlight (at least for me) has to be Nancy Kelly's performance. Delightful, charming, and funny would be a few of the adjectives I'd use to describe Kelly in Double Exposure. Her performance raises the film's enjoyment in my eyes to a notch slightly above average. Overall, if you go into Double Exposure without a ton of expectations, you might discover a nice little movie worth watching.\\n\\nFinally, another bit I liked was the storyline given to ex-boyfriend, Ben. I won't spoil it, but his final scene actually surprised me. Well done.\\n\\n6/10.                                                                                                                                                                                                 1\n",
       "Chester Morris stars with Nancy Kelly, Philip Terry, and Jane Farrar star in \"Double Exposure\" from 1944.\\n\\nChester Morris as Larry Burke works at a picture magazine called Flick, and he's not above faking a shot to get a good cover. The company needs photographers, so when his boss sees a plane crash photo done by one Pat Marvin, he has Larry hire him.\\n\\nWhen Pat arrives, he's a she, and a very attractive one at that. Pat has left behind a boyfriend, Ben (Terry) to come to New York, except that he shows up. She tells Larry that Ben is her brother. Larry gives him a job as well.\\n\\nLarry assigns Pat and Ben to a fictional murder mystery case that will involve photos. Pat has attracted a millionaire who is on his sixth wife or so and is going to Reno to divorce him. He gives Pat the keys to his apartment. So she and Ben set up the murder scene there.\\n\\nTo their surprise, there is a murder at the apartment later - and the pose is exactly like Pat's, face down on the divan. Naturally the police arrive. They believe Pat photographed the murdered woman after killing her, so she's indicted and is stuck in jail. Larry loves the publicity, but he realizes the murder has to be solved to get her out. So he goes to work.\\n\\nFunny, fast-moving film with some wild characters, including the crazy boss who makes his employees do calisthenics and passes out carrots. Morris and Kelly have good chemistry.\\n\\nI especially loved the photo faking which included a lot of cutting, pasting, and white-out. Just think, with Photoshop it would have been nothing.                                                              1\n",
       "George Lucas crafted an interesting narrative. Nope. The film is a disconnected series of vignettes that never converge or land with any impact.\\n\\nLucas' direction was skillful and interesting. Nope. There was nothing in the direction that felt connected or special. The scenes seemed to be blocked for ease of shooting and little more. If the movie hadn't been set at night, it would have been a visual bomb.\\n\\nThe characters were compelling and realistic. Nope. It was a series of tired archetypes.\\n\\nThe film was emotional and dramatic. Nope. I didn't develop any sense of empathy or sympathy for any of them.\\n\\nThe film was genuinely funny. Nope. How this was billed as a comedy is a total mystery.\\n\\nThe music was appropriate and woven well into the story. Nope. The music, while time appropriate, was overbearing and disconnected from the \"story\" (there wasn't one).\\n\\nBut there was a LOT of Wolfman Jack (for what that's worth).\\n\\nIf American Graffiti was ever considered a good film, it has lost its appeal over the years. I'm glad it scratches the itch for 75 year-olds as a trip down some mythical memory lane, but a good movie it is not.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       1\n",
